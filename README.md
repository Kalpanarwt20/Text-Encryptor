Text Encryptor
This is a simple text encryption and decryption application built in Python using the Tkinter library. It provides options to encrypt and decrypt text using various algorithms such as AES, DES, and RSA. The application was developed as part of a Cybersecurity internship at Pinnacle Labs.

Features
Encrypt and decrypt text using AES, DES, or RSA algorithms. Generate encryption and decryption keys automatically. Copy keys and ciphertext to the clipboard for convenience. Simple and intuitive graphical user interface using Tkinter. Error handling for invalid input formats and decryption failures.

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/Cpahi/Text-Encryptor.git Navigate to the project directory:

bash Copy code cd Text-Encryptor Run the Python script:

bash Copy code python text_encryptor.py Enter the text you want to encrypt or the ciphertext you want to decrypt in the text box.

Click on either the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to choose the operation.

Select the desired encryption/decryption algorithm.

Follow the prompts to input keys or ciphertext.

View the encrypted or decrypted text in a message box.
